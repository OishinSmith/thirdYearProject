## 1 Introduction ID Wallet

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of our system is to provide a platform where the general population is able to
utilise the convenience of their smart devices, such as smartphones and tablets, by safely
storing their identity documents (IDs) on our cloud server. It allows users to store their IDs,
and also to use them wherever our system is supported. Our system is composed of two
Android applications. The main application is called ‘ID Wallet’, but will be referred to as the
‘User app’ from now on, and the second application is called ‘ID Wallet – Admin’, which will
be referred to as the ‘Admin app’ from now on.
These two apps are required to work in conjunction in certain scenarios. To further clarify the
previous statement, person A wishing to use their ID that’s stored on the User app, will need
a person B, that has access to the Admin app, and that is authorised to use its functionality,
to, for example, verify person A’s ID.

### 1.2 Scope

This guide aims to give the user all of the necessary information to be capable of using our
system without any difficulties or ambiguities. Due to a potentially large range of the users’
technical skills, the guide will explain every point thoroughly. It is important to consider
however, that in the case of a security breach of our cloud server user information may be
exposed, and in such an event the users would be notified immediately.
Further considerations include potential theft of a smart device with the User app installed, in
which case malicious misuse might occur if an ID has already been added to the app. In
such a scenario please contact us immediately at ​walletid.dcu@gmail.com​. When wishing to
use an ID on the User app, another consideration to keep in mind is the possibility that the
authorised person with the Admin app may screenshot your ID when it is displayed on their
screen, again, in such an event, contact us at the above email address.


## 2 User App

### 2.1 First-time Users

First time users of the ID-Wallet app will have to turn on their NFC when using the App. They
must also have their physical ID with them when wanting to store their ID on ID-Wallet user
version. It is also important to have a gmail account or similar to be able to sign into the app
on the login screen.

### 2.2 Access Control

To register on the app, the user has to press the sign up through google button as shown
below

![1](https://i.imgur.com/r6FRIJM.jpg)

Next, they will be presented with the screen shown below. The top left icon is used to sign
you out of your account, it will also bring you to the login page of the app. The ID’s button will
display the ID’s present on your phone as shown below. And on the top right of the
navigation bar is the information button which we thought was important as it is an app that
uses different technologies such as NFC and may be confusing to the user.

![2](https://i.imgur.com/6re2aET.jpg)


The user will be generating buttons with chosen names as place holders for their ID’s. When
the button “ID” is pressed in the image below, a new screen will be shown

![3](https://i.imgur.com/Dz6tZYZ.jpg)

This screen will display a message telling you that a message (Your ID) can be sent to the
Admin App
Each user, when signing in through google will generate a HashMap which will be used to
store the user generated ID names and their corresponding ID url.

### 2.3 Installing the System

To install the app the user must navigate to our ID-Wallet Blog
The links to the apps can be found here:
https://idwallet.blog/2019/03/08/id-wallet-app-download/
There will be two versions of it, the customer version and the bouncer version. If you wish to
be the one storing your ID, then pick the user version of the app. And for Businesses pick
the Admin version.
When you click on the link to install either app, a pop up will appear telling you that it is not
secure to download the app from this source. Press settings and then you will be presented
with a slide bar which you have to press in order to download the app from google drive.
The two pictures below show examples of what you will encounter.
Once you do the below, you'll be able to download the app and it will automatically install.

### 2.4 Starting the System

1. To turn the application on, first find it in the app drawer of your Android device. In the
    screenshot below, it’s shown as ‘ID Wallet-...’, because the app name is too long to
    be fully displayed in some situations.

![5](https://i.imgur.com/qaMUsKV.png)


2. Once the app has been located, simply touch, or click on its icon once to start it.

### 2.5 Stopping the System

ID-Wallet can be deleted by finding the app on your phone dashboard, pressing and holding
the app for a couple of seconds and then press uninstall.
To interrupt the app, simply press the home button.


### 2.6 Step by Step Instructions For Using the System

When using the ID-Wallet User version of the app, a user must know that there are two
stages when using the app. The first stage is the registration part and the second stage is
the Show ID part. These stages will be described below.
1. Registration
2. When you first open the ID-Wallet app, you will be presented with a login screen. Click
the google sign in button to automatically register and setup your account online. The image
below shows an example of the login screen.

![6](https://i.imgur.com/mQ76F8A.jpg)

3. Now, to be able to store your ID in the ID-Wallet app, You must first bring your physical
ID with you. A bouncer, with the Admin app version of ID-Wallet will ask for identification, at
that point you may ask to register your ID on the app.
4. the Bouncer will verify your physical ID and take a picture of it, in order to be able to
store it online. Then the Bouncer will go to you and ask you to turn on NFC on your phone.
5. The Bouncer will send an NFC message to you which is basically your online ID.
6. Now that you have received the NFC message from the bouncer, you should type the
name that you wish to give the ID in the text box (for example 'Passport') and the ID (in the
form of a button) will now be automatically generated and stored on your phone for future
use. An example is shown in the image below.

![7](https://i.imgur.com/BU39HYQ.jpg)

Stage 2 Show ID
7. Your ID has been stored on your ID-Wallet account, there are a couple of options that
you have.
8. the user may choose to click the button with their generated ID name. When the button is
clicked, it will bring you to a screen displaying an NFC symbol. When a bouncer asks you for
ID, take out your phone and place it against theirs. Your phone will vibrate, prompting you to
click the screen of your phone to send your ID to the Bouncer. The Bouncer will then check
the validity of the ID.

![8](https://i.imgur.com/q1ufYGJ.jpg)


9. A user may also delete an ID by pressing the “X” button on the right of the ID button
name. When the “X” button is pressed, an alert box will appear asking the user if they really
want to delete ID. If the user presses “Yes”, the ID button will be permanently deleted. If the
user presses “No” then nothing will happen.

10. To look for information about the app and a more simplified guide on how to use
ID-Wallet, press the information button on the top right. As this is an app that can seem very
complicated for new users to use, we thought it would be a great idea to have an information
button within the app, incase any user doesn’t know how to fully use it.
11. on the top left is the Logout button. When this button is pressed, it will log you out of your
current session and bring you to the login page.
